## Weather App
**This project is a basic weather app that retrieves weather data using an API and displays it in a visually appealing way. You’ll learn how to structure the HTML, style it with CSS, and use JavaScript to fetch and display weather information.**
Note: This is a simplified example. In a real-world project, you’d handle error handling, unit tests, and more.
